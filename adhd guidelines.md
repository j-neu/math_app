## 1. **Use Concrete, Visual, and Hands-On Learning**

* Kids with ADHD learn better when math is **tangible**.
* Research shows that manipulatives (blocks, counters, number lines, fraction circles) help them grasp concepts more effectively than abstract symbols alone.
* Visual supports like **color coding, charts, and diagrams** reduce working memory demands.

👉 Example: Instead of just teaching "3 × 4," let them group 3 sets of 4 objects with blocks first, then write the equation.

## 2. **Keep Lessons Short and Chunked**

* Attention spans for kids with ADHD are shorter, especially for non-preferred tasks.
* Studies show that **short, focused lessons with breaks** improve retention.
* "Spaced practice" (short daily reviews instead of long sessions) is more effective for long-term memory.

👉 Example: Teach math in **10–15 minute bursts**, interspersed with active breaks.

---

## 3. **Active, Movement-Based Learning**

* Exercise and movement boost dopamine and norepinephrine, which are deficient in ADHD brains.
* Embedding math in movement helps learning stick.
* Randomized controlled trials (e.g., “exergaming” or kinesthetic math activities) show improved math outcomes.

👉 Example: Solve problems by hopping on a number line taped to the floor.

---

## 4. **Frequent Feedback and Immediate Reinforcement**

* Kids with ADHD benefit from **instant feedback**—they don’t do as well with delayed grading.
* Positive reinforcement (praise, tokens, game-like elements) increases motivation and persistence.
* Error correction should be quick and encouraging, not delayed or punitive.

👉 Example: Digital math tools with instant feedback (like Reflex Math, ST Math, or Prodigy) can help.

---

## 5. **Teach Problem-Solving Strategies Explicitly**

* Many ADHD learners struggle with multi-step problems due to working memory weaknesses.
* Evidence shows that teaching **step-by-step strategies, mnemonics, or checklists** helps them succeed.

👉 Example: Teach a sequence like **RIDE** for word problems:

* **R**ead the problem
* **I**dentify the information
* **D**ecide on the operation
* **E**xecute the plan

---

## 6. **Leverage Technology**

* Computer-assisted instruction has strong evidence for improving math outcomes in ADHD populations.
* Interactive programs provide adaptive practice, instant feedback, and engagement.

👉 Example: Use apps that turn math practice into short games.

---

## 7. **Emotional and Behavioral Support**

* Math anxiety is common in ADHD kids, and stress worsens performance.
* Creating a **low-pressure, supportive environment** improves persistence.
* Self-regulation tools (timers, goal trackers, movement breaks) reduce frustration.

✅ **In summary:**
The best evidence suggests **hands-on, visual, short, game-like, and interactive learning**, with **immediate feedback and movement**, works best for young students with ADHD learning math basics. Combining structured teaching with breaks and reinforcement creates the strongest outcomes.
